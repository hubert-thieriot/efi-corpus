                <p>This is a test article about Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and their 2021 analysis. The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) is a public interest research and advocacy organisation based in New Delhi. CSE researches into, lobbies for and communicates the urgency of development that is both sustainable and equitable.</p>
                <p>The analysis shows that emissions from power plants can travel over 300 km and affect air quality. This comprehensive study reveals that particulate matter and other pollutants from thermal power plants have a much wider impact than previously thought. The research indicates that these emissions can travel over 300 km and significantly affect air quality in surrounding regions.</p>
                <p>Municipal Corporation Gurugram (MCG) has set up a grievance redressal cell to improve public service efficiency. The MCG has established a dedicated grievance redressal cell to streamline the process of addressing public complaints and improving overall service delivery. This initiative aims to enhance transparency and accountability in municipal services.</p>
                <p>For diabetics, it's important to be vigilant for any changes in vision as diabetes can cause eye conditions. Diabetes management requires careful attention to various health aspects, including regular eye examinations. It's crucial for diabetics to be vigilant for any changes in vision, as diabetes can cause various eye conditions that may lead to serious complications if left untreated.</p>
                <p>The IMD has predicted dense to very dense fog for the day, which may affect air quality and delay trains. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued warnings about dense to very dense fog conditions that are expected to persist throughout the day. These weather conditions may significantly affect air quality and cause delays in train services across the region.</p>
                <p>Additional content to ensure we meet the minimum length requirements for all test cases. This paragraph provides supplementary information about environmental monitoring, public health initiatives, and infrastructure development projects that are relevant to the topics covered in our test scenarios.</p>
