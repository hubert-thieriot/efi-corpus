DOMAIN: {{ domain }}
Goal: Induce a compact, non-overlapping set of frames that covers these passages well (typically 6–9). Choose the number that best balances coverage and distinctness.

Constraints
- Keep descriptions short (≤ 2 sentences).
- Provide 5–8 lexical_cues (quoted triggers) and 2–4 semantic_cues per frame.
- Provide 1–2 short examples when possible.
- Use boundary_notes (1–2) to explain differences vs. close frames.
- Do not include decision rules, regex, or long anti-trigger lists.

{% if frame_guidance %}Guidance (optional):
{{ frame_guidance }}

{% endif %}Passages (≤ {{ max_passages_per_call }}, sampled & deduped):
